# Java-firstProject

This is my first project in Java. This is not very complicated program but I am pleased. <br />
This program is askinkg and responding to the user. <br />
<br />
## The program will ask you about: <br />
- Your name and will welcome you accordingly ;)
- Your age and give you a warning or comment

If you are an ancient general and statesman killed in the Ides od March at fifty-five years old, then the program will greet you with the greeting *Ave Cesar morituri te salutant* and warn you against Brutus.
